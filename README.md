# Hi, I’m Gracie

Front-End Developer | HTML, CSS, JavaScript | Learning React

I create clean, interactive, and visually engaging web experiences. What excites me most about coding is how *just typing lines of code* — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — can turn into something colorful, functional, and creative. It’s a simple idea, but it never stops amazing me!

## Featured Project

### QR Code Component – Frontend Mentor
A responsive UI component built with semantic HTML and CSS.  
This project strengthened my understanding of layout, responsiveness, and clean structure.
